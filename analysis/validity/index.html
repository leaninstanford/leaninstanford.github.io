    Validity of the Myth
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    How true is the myth?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Leaning in does not necessarily translate to greater success in the tech
    world. Especially for women. At Stanford women are provided with this
    bubble of opportunity and encouragement, but this does not naturally
    translate to the world outside of Stanford.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The Tech World
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Silicon Valley, the epicenter of technological growth across the world has
    made it its mission to apply its technological advances to all parts of
    society; whether it be through communication efforts with companies such as
    Twitter and Facebook, through shopping experiences with Amazon, through
    banking with Wells Fargo, or through the driving experience with Tesla.
    This is just to name a few of the companies that have incredible, far
    reaching power, all with having over twenty billion in assets, with some
    companies even reaching into the trillions. These companies strive to
    impart change on the world yet fail to bring about that change through
    their very practices, rather they simply desire to create the technologies
    to do the heavy lifting that can serve as the medium to bring about the
    change, without having to actually implement it themselves.
</p>
<br/>

    Silicon Valley Community Foundation claims to engage with donors in Silicon
    Valley to make the region and world a better place for all through
    innovative giving strategies. They value diversity, inclusiveness, and
    public accountability.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The dichotomy of this philanthropic giving institution for Silicon Valley
    leaders is that the power to affect change already lies within their hands
    at the organizations they run and manage. They are capable of directly
    changing the imbalance in inequality in our society through their company's
    practices.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    For example, Google, a company valued by Forbes as over $101 billion, and
    cited as facilitating $165 billion in economic activity nationwide, is
    directly influential in impacting change. The company’s mission statement
    states that it aims to organize the world’s information and make it
    universally acceptable and useful. This same company though is not making
    accessible the incredible opportunities it has for individuals at its
    fingertips. The diversity statistics of the company have it divided at 70%
    male and 30% female with 63% of its employee population being white, 30%
    asian, 3% hispanic, and 2% black. This lack of diversity within its members
    is disheartening as it highlights the discrepancy between what the company
    claims to impart on the world and what it is actually doing.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Isolating Women
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    In a study done by Alison Wynn, a Stanford graduate student, and Shelley
    Correll, a Stanford professor, they explored the recruiting environment for
    women established by tech companies at recruiting events. Through first
    hand data they collected from over eighty four recruiting events, they
    found that the tech companies were all but inclusive through their events.
    They were often male dominated with an emphasis on the ‘bro-appealing’
    aspects of their company from foosball tables, to a low-priority sleep
    culture, to beer fridges. If women were apart of the presentation, they
    were often just deemed smiling, corner worthy recruiters who would hand out
    swag and if they ever did talk would only speak to the company’s culture
    and the long term hopes, almost as an excuse for the clear execution of
    gender roles through their presentation. These companies come to Stanford
    to recruit from a talented and diverse community, but end up polarizing a
    the female population through their isolating events, and only hurt
    themselves.
</p>

    It is natural for people to want to be good at what they do, being good at
    it definitely makes it more enjoyable and easier. The tech sphere though
    pushes its intense and unwavering culture on hopeful members and it can be
    a strong deterrent. The concept of having it all for a woman, does not
    necessarily mean that they do want it all, but there is the hope to leave
    all doors open and to make that decision for oneself. The ‘work till 2am’
    culture and the exclusive community isolates a women and not only leaves
    her feeling like she can’t have it all, it makes her feel as though she
    doesn’t even have the bandwidth to choose what she does want. The
    cookie-cutter and pre-set path of all who enter the tech world is no fun
    for those trying to live their own life. This double standard and
    discrepancy between what is desired and what is the reality of a life in
    tech reflects J.Z. Smith’s statement that there is a disparity between what
    people profess and what they actually do.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    As previously mentioned, the fast-paced and cookie-cut path of a job in
    Silicon Valley makes it difficult for women to fit if they have decided to
    try to have it all. The image of a working mother does not click with the
    expectations of a job in tech. Venture Capital firms in Silicon Valley have
    had a hard time reckoning the gap in experience for mothers who have taken
    maternity leave. Emily Holtz Patterson speaks of her experience in a The
    Verge article, she was let go a month after coming back from maternity
    leave. The on ramps that exist in other professional fields to keep the
    retention of working mothers simply does not exist in tech.

<p dir="ltr">
    It’s an industry that moves so fast that if you’re not actively always in
    it and helping to move it along quickly and efficiently, you’re simply side
    swept for someone else. This same aspect of the industry not only applies
    to the lack of gender diversity, but also to the lack of racial diversity.
    It is easier to communicate with someone who has your same background, same
    race, same upbringing, same socioeconomic class, same language. As terrible
    as this sounds, it’s true. That does not make it good or right though. The
    tech industry lacks an added value because of it and it is what keeps the
    cookie-cutter life path of the tech industry able to persevere.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are efforts to counter this pervading concept of life in the tech
    world and to empower women in some capacity. The Technical Women’s
    Leadership Journey is striving to educate women in leadership roles in the
    tech sphere. However, as has already been seen though, it is not an issue
    of education, women are more than equipped and qualified to excel, it is
    rather the culture that continues to hold them down.
