<p>1. We have paid scant attention to the theoretical study of the campus rituals. The ritualistic activities participated by female Stanford students associated with the myth can be divided into two categories: individual-based and community-based.</p>
<p>Here, individual-based rituals refer to actions pursued by individuals in isolation from other members who carry out the same rituals. Such rituals are observed in many cultures, including the Abrahamic religions (baptism, Bar Mitzvah, first recitation of the&nbsp;<em>Quran</em> from memory), the people of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu (<a title="Attenborough-1966" href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/251/772/503">Attenborough 1966</a>), and the Arunta of central Australia (see pp. 161-162 of <a title="Henrich-2016" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html">Henrich 2016</a>). Typically, individual-based rituals are "rites of passage" or initiations that serve to award class membership to an individual upon his or her successful completion of the ritual. In contrast, community-based rituals are actions involving multiple individual participants situated in close proximity to one another. These include the church Mass, Sama ceremony, Irakia Awa pig rituals (<a title="Boyd-2001" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010942014773">Boyd 2001</a>, see also p. 173 of <a title="Henrich-2016" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html">Henrich 2016</a>), and Australian Aboriginal song cycles (Birdsell 1979 in <a title="Bernstein-Smith-1979" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PgPbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=primate+ecology+and+human+origins&amp;dq=primate+ecology+and+human+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6upiR7IDbAhXJrVQKHVKWDkAQ6AEIPjAE">this volume</a>, see also p. 131 of <a title="Henrich-2016" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html">Henrich 2016</a>).</p>
