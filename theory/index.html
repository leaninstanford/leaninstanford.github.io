<p>We saw at the end of <strong>Origins</strong> that various pieces of evidence seem to suggest</p>
<ol>
<li>Women at Stanford are leaning in, getting equal opportunities in tech, and realizing dreams</li>
<li>Stanford, with all its opportunities and community-building initiatives, prepare a generation of women who will enter tech and balance the gender ratio in Silicon Valley</li>
</ol>
<p>We know the second myth is false, thanks to (i) <a title="2018 Wired Article" href="https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/">statistics</a> and <a title="Climbing the Technical Ladder" href="http://gender.stanford.edu/climbing-technical-ladder-0">studies</a> on the underrepresentation of women in Silicon Valley and other tech communities more broadly, and (ii) interviews and personal stories from female tech employees and tech entrepreneurs. The first myth is also not entirely true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We address the claims above in <strong>Analysis</strong>. Here, we consider how, regardless of whether 1. and 2. are true, such myths continue to create lasting impressions within Stanford. In particular, we explore</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>The power of the myth in sanctioning and routinizing particular rituals</li>
<li>The perpetuation of the myth through the exact same rituals</li>
<li>Other theories for perpetuation of the myth</li>
</ol>

<p><em>[A].</em> The pairing of myth and ritual dates back to the <a title="Cambridge Ritualists - Wikpedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Ritualists">Cambridge Ritualists</a>, who thought that myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual. Adopting this approach, we consider how the first myth sanctions and routinizes various campus rituals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Stanford, women-focused STEM student groups organize panels, faculty talks, company tours, informal mixers and coffee chats with female professionals --- all of which are attended by many female students interested in tech-related fields. Additionally, some groups pair underclasswomen with upperclasswomen, in so-called Sibling Family ("Sib Fam") programs. As a female mechanical engineering undergraduate (Class of 2019) and member of <a title="Stanford Society of Women Engineers" href="http://swe.stanford.edu/">Stanford Society of Women Engineers</a> puts it,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think that a big component of all of them is mentorship and role models. It can be hard to find women in male-dominated fields, so getting advice from someone slightly older than you helps women both prepare for the future and see working in these roles as a real possibility."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We observe that the myth, which freshly arrived female students are aware of, encourages them to explore and partake in such community-based activities (viewed as rituals) without fear of isolation or not belonging. Various anthropological theories can account for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Malinowski, through ethnographic studies of Melanesian populations, noted the importance of myths (to its adherents) in sanctioning rituals and in maintaining the complex social organization of a population. At Stanford, students who identify with the myth participate in the activities described above. They do so together, out of each and every individual's belief in the myth. The student groups and related events like the <a title="Women in Data Science" href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/09/women-data-science/">Women in Data Science conference</a>, in which professional connections between networks of women scientists and engineers are created, testify to the formation and maintenance of social relations among Stanford women in STEM that are centered on the myth.</p>
<p>Another point of view originates in the etiological approach, which sees myths as "primitive science" offering heuristic explanations for natural phenomena. The myth plays the role of an explanation for the apparent success of Stanford students at obtaining jobs in Silicon Valley. Because of the warm ties between Stanford and Silicon Valley, anyone from Stanford (male or female) who works hard ("leans in") is set to land a job in a tech company and have their future set in stone (because it's Silicon Valley, the land of wealth, creation and innovation).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern evolutionary approaches may offer a more illuminating and useful account. Several cultural evolutionists (e.g. Joseph Henrich, Michael Muthukrishna) have proposed theories for the existence and persistence of religion. The members of&nbsp; &nbsp;itself has the effect of hastening and intensifying the transmission of the rituals described above.</p>
