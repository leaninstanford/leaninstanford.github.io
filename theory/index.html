<p>We saw at the end of <strong>Origins</strong> that various pieces of evidence seem to suggest</p>
<ol>
<li>Women at Stanford are leaning in, getting equal opportunities in tech, and realizing dreams</li>
<li>Stanford, with all its opportunities and community-building initiatives, prepare a generation of women who will enter tech and balance the gender ratio in Silicon Valley</li>
</ol>
<p>We know the second point is false, thanks to (i) <a title="2018 Wired Article" href="https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/">statistics</a> and <a title="Climbing the Technical Ladder" href="http://gender.stanford.edu/climbing-technical-ladder-0">studies</a> on the underrepresentation of women in Silicon Valley and other tech communities more broadly, and (ii) interviews and personal stories from female tech employees and tech entrepreneurs. The first point is also not entirely true (more on this later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We address the claims above in <strong>Analysis</strong>. Here, we consider how, regardless of whether 1. and 2. are true, such myths continue to create lasting impressions within Stanford. In particular, we explore</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>The ritualistic mechanism by which such myths are perpetuated</li>
<li>The power of the myth in routinizing the same rituals</li>
<li>Other theories for perpetuation of the myth</li>
</ol>

<p>A. The pairing of myth and ritual dates back to the <a title="Cambridge Ritualists - Wikpedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Ritualists">Cambridge Ritualists</a>, who thought that myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual. Adopting this approach, we consider how the myths of leaning in and having it all, in accordance with Malinowski, sanction various campus rituals.&nbsp;</p>
