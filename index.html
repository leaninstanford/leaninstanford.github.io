            <p>Welcome! This site explores the myth and rituals of "leaning in" and "having it all" at <a title="Stanford University" href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. Women involvement, inclusion and participation in tech are topics hotly debated in Silicon Valley, and the validity and importance of these phenomena are disagreed upon by many different groups at Stanford (students, faculty, etc.).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Join us as we delve into the origins of the myth, explain the phenomena using ideas from religious studies theory and cultural evolution, tease apart falsehoods from facts, and show how all this leads to concrete solutions that not only balance the gender disparity in Silicon Valley but also create more sustainable futures for the tech landscape.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
