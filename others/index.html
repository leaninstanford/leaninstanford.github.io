<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We have explored the origins of the myths that Stanford women in tech "lean in" and "have it all," as well as their associated rituals. We have considered how such myths fit into theoretical frameworks for studying religion put forth by anthropologists, biologists and cultural historians. We have queried the belief that female Stanford students will become successful in STEM, as long as they participate in the rituals associated with the myth. Our approach not only demonstrates the applicability of multiple theoretical and empirical perspectives to the study of women in tech, but also suggests the need for more data to advance claims about the biases toward women in tech. As more data and statistical analyses of such data become available, they will supply concrete evidence that may supplement personal stories and shared experiences, to raise awareness among the STEM community and to galvanize transformations in perceptions of women in tech.</p>
