<p>Stanford University has a reputation for being at the heart of Silicon Valley, and for playing an important role in creating and sustaining the ability of the valley to innovate. Articles abound on the special status of Stanford in transforming the world, notably through technological innovation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Stanford's location in the Wild West and its entrepreneurial spirit also suggest the proliferation of alternative and new ideas, relaxed lifestyles, and a progressive culture <a title="Business-Insider-article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-stanford-university-is-an-awesome-college-2014-9">leading</a> <a title="New-Yorker-article" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/30/get-rich-u">to</a> <a title="Tech-Crunch-article" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/what-will-stanford-be-without-silicon-valley/">success</a>. No wonder it's easy to imagine Stanford and Silicon Valley as places of positive change, of inspiration, of creative impact. No wonder Stanford and Silicon Valley are perceived as radical departures from the technically demanding, mentally focused and all-round hardcore culture defining many other human ecologies (think East Coast investment banking, Beijing business, London finance, Singapore tech). No wonder, as the current hype for tech continues to grow and more men and women enter the industry, there is the impression that tech will be an enterprise guided by progressive and transformational values, with a philosophy of embracing diversity and valuing contribution over background. Perhaps women, through participating in tech, can finally have it all?</p>
<p>As it turns out, "having it all" is closely related to the idea of "leaning in," which was popularized by Sheryl Sandberg and Nell Scovell in <a title="Lean-In-book" href="https://leanin.org/book/">their book</a> of the same name?&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the video above shows, Sandberg suggests that women can access many new opportunities as long as they muster their confidence to challenge the status quo, and to keep the drive going. The phrase "lean in" has since become absorbed into common language, with many individuals using the phrase to refer to the relentless, committed pursuit of a goal.</p>
<p>Since Sandberg's book and her sharing of her views through <a title="TED-talk-2014" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_so_we_leaned_in_now_what/transcript?language=en">public talks</a>, many women have heeded her advice. Notably at Stanford, which is a warm neighbor to many tech giants and startups, there is some evidence that more and more women are getting involved with STEM and even succeeding at landing internships and job offers. Stanford campus boasts multiple student groups focused on building community for women:</p>

<p>Additionally, recent <a title="Reuters-article" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009">statistics</a> and <a title="WIDS-conference-2018" href="https://www.widsconference.org/">events</a> also suggest that more women at Stanford are participating and achieving success and recognition in the field.</p>
<p>All the above may hype up the involvement and success of women in tech, and certainly helps conjure the idea that women at Stanford are "leaning in" and therefore "having it all."</p>
<p>In <strong>Theory</strong>, we try to uncover the mechanisms that drive this myth as well as the associated rituals, drawing from anthropological and cultural studies of religion, myths and rituals. In <strong>Analysis</strong>, we evaluate the factuality of the myth.</p>
